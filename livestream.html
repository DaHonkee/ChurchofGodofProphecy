                        <strong>Put God First:</strong> Denzel emphasizes the importance of recognizing that all achievements are through God's grace. He shares a personal anecdote from 1975 when he was struggling academically, and a woman prophesied that he would travel the world and speak to millions of people. This prophecy came true, and he attributes his success to keeping God first in his life.

                        <strong>Fail Big and Have Goals:</strong> He encourages the graduates to take risks and not be afraid of failure, as it's an integral part of success. He stresses the importance of having dreams but also setting specific goals to achieve them. Discipline and consistency are key to reaching these goals.

                    <li>
                        <strong>You Can't Take It With You:</strong> Denzel points out the futility of materialism by saying you'll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. He suggests that true wealth is not measured by one's possessions but by what one does with them. The act of helping others is described as the most rewarding experience, far surpassing material gains.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Gratitude and Giving Back:</strong> He advises to start each day with gratitude by literally getting on one's knees to reach for slippers placed under the bed, using this moment to express thanks for life's blessings. He also speaks about the importance of giving back, encouraging the audience to not only aspire to make a living but to make a difference in the lives of others.
